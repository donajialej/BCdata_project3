1) Survey literature and find promoter+enhancer pairs to generate synthetic data.

2) Implement and/or come up with good ways to deal with the reverse complement problem.

3) Find new/better way to do the MaxPooling - i.e. keep info on the distance between the motifs.

4) Study the motifs/filters we get and connect to known motifs.
